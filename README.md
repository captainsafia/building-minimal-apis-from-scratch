# Building Minimal APIs from Scratch

This repo contains the code for my talk "Building Minimal APIs from Scratch" which explores the underpinnings of minimal APIs in particular and API frameworks in general by building a simple prototype that replicates the behavior of ASP.NET Core's minimal APIs.

The `katas.hurl` file contains a set of test cases that can be used to evaluate the behavior of the framework implemented.

The entire API is implemented in a single file-based C# app and can be executed by running:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run app.cs
```
